My first blog on tools is about using [vim](https://www.vim.org/) and [spacevim](https://spacevim.org/). It might be a bit surprising, as this blog is about geospatial data science rather than coding. Why am I introducing a text editor as the first blog of geospatial tools? The simple answer is I like vim.
Well, Iâ€™m, by no means, a Vim expert, but I just would like to share something that I am learning, and I think vim, specifically spacevim, makes my work more efficient, productive, and fun, although the learning curve is a bit steep.
Vim is just a text editor like Notepad, Sublime Text, and Atom.
