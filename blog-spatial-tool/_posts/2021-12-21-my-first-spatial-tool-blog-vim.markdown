My first blog on tools is about using [vim](https://www.vim.org/) and [spacevim](https://spacevim.org/). It might be a bit surprising, as this blog is about geospatial data science rather than coding. Why am I introducing a text editor as the first blog of geospatial tools? First, I like vim. Second, all blogs are written using vim and spacevim, so I'd like to give vim credit.
First of all, I have to acknowledge that Iâ€™m, by no means, a Vim expert. I just would like to share something that I am learning and that might be useful to others as well.

Another handy tool I use on a Mac is [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/). 

### What is Vim?
To learn what vim is, pls see [here](https://opensource.com/resources/what-vim). 
Most deem that Vim is just a text editor like Notepad, Sublime Text, and Atom; some may think vim is mostly about customizing keybindings or IDE interface. 

Well, for me, vim is a whole new way of interacting with computers. I used to heavily depend on GUIs, and I even felt a bit overwhelmed whenever I need to install something via command line tools, but now I like command lines. It is very efficient to locate things and do stuff. 
Vim makes my work more efficient, productive, and fun, although the learning curve is steep, but the time spent on it is worthing, as I learned a whole lot of things that I may never know. Most data scientists use Python or R in the daily work, so the most poputer IDEs might be JupyterLab and RStudio. 

For the purpose of programming with R or Python alone, it is fine to use those tools you are familiar with. However, if one will also write scripts such as command line shells such as bash and zsh, ruby, go, markdown, etc., it is worthing spending some time on vim, as instead of installing different IDEs for different languages, it is convenient to let one do all the jobs.

### Basic Vim Commands
Before we start to learn vim commends, it is important to understand that Vim has modes:

1. Command Mode: You cannot write text in command mode. When you start Vim, you are placed in Command mode. In this mode, you can locate and modify text such as moving across the screen, deleting and coping text.
2. Insert Mode: When you want to write something on a file, you must enter the insert mode by typing "i" or "a" or some other commands.

To learn more commands, see [Basic Vim Commands](https://vim.rtorr.com/). Do not feel overwhelmed, as we do not need to remember all of them to use vim. First, [install vim](https://www.vim.org/download.php) and simply use keys such as h, j, k, l to move your cursor across the screen. Second, type "i", and write some texts. It is fun. If you are a heavy mouse user, it will be very inconvenient at first, but after a couple of months, you will love vim.
In this process, you may go back to the basic vim commands page quite a lot. 

### Vim and Neovim
