Hello, everyone! Welcome to my blog site! I'm Hengshan, a technical mananger in Singapore Land Authority. Everyday I will post some stuff that I learned about spatial modelling, optimization, statistics, and VR. This blog is mainly for myself to make notes, but I will be more than happy if it is useful to others as well.
