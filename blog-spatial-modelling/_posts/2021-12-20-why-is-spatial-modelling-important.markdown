[The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda), adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015,
provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for our people and our planet. 
One of its vision is:
>we envisage a world in which every country enjoys sustained, inclusive and sustainable
economic growth and decent work for all. A world in which consumption and production patterns
and use of all natural resources – from air to land, from rivers, lakes and aquifers to oceans
and seas - are sustainable. One in which democracy, good governance and the rule of law as well as
an enabling environment at national and international levels, are essential for sustainable development,
including sustained and inclusive economic growth, social development, environmental protection and the eradication of poverty and hunger. One in which development and the application of technology are climate-sensitive, respect biodiversity and are resilient. One in which humanity lives in harmony with nature and in which wildlife and other living species are protected.

This sounds fantastic! But some may doubt whether and when we can get there and how to get there? Frankly, I have no idea as well.
Some may think this is too good to be true and therefore do nothing. Some may think this is irrelevant to them and therefore do nothing.
However, I do know that a lot of people have been working on this no matter what.

I remember Will Smith once said:
> Siddhartha Gautama — the Buddha — he said that ‘good people have to get out of the bed every day and try to empty the ocean with a ladle.’
> I knew that was profound and I paused for a second and I said ‘alright, what the hell is a ladle?’
> So then I touched it on my iPad and ‘oh, it’s like a big spoon.’
> A big spoon, okay. So like a soup spoon. So trying to empty the ocean with a soup spoon,
> you know, as the mentality of how you wake up every day to try to do good in the world.”

Well then, to achieve that goal or dream, as a data scientist, what can **I** do? This is my motivation to start this blog site. 
I want to do a little thing that may make this world a little better than when I was born. This is somewhat selfish, as 
I prefer to working for a mission or vision(something meaningful) rather than working for someone, including myself. 
of course, to get there, all of us need to work together. Even though one day in future we may enjoy more living in the Metaverse or Mars,
I'd like to do something now, because I love the earth.

### What is Spatial Modeling?

Our environment, economy, and society are facing a lot of challenges.
Spatial modeling can help us better understand these environmental or social phenomena with mathematical and statistical models. 

The objective of spatial modeling is to study and simulate phenomena that occur in the real world (maybe Metaverse in future)
and facilitate data-driven problem solving and planning. For example, spatial modeling can be used to
analyze the projected path of tornadoes [(see here)](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/1940/spatial-modeling).
Another example is that we can watch the Earth breathe (averaged atmospheric carbon dioxide) from space based on earth observation data.
With spatial modeling, we can analyze the spatial temporal pattern of the "breath" and provide data-driven insights to facilitate policy decision-making.
